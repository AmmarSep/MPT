Masjid Prayer Timings

## Web App
This project includes a simple static web app for managing prayer timings for multiple masjids.

- Shows 3 masjids with prayer times for `Fajr`, `Dhuhr`, `Asr`, `Maghrib`, and `Isha`.
- Lets you edit masjid names and prayer times directly in the UI.
- Saves all changes in `localStorage` so data persists after refresh.

Open `index.html` in your browser to use the app.
